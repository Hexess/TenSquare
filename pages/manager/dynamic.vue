        <p class="content">A private member (i) is only accessible within the same class as it is declared. A member with no access modifier (j) is only accessible within classes in the same package. A protected member (k) is accessible within all classes in the same package and within subclasses in other packages. A public member (l) is accessible to all classes (unless it resides in a module that does not export the package it is declared in).</p>
